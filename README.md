# northern-european-political-tweet-classification
For this project, my team used a data set with 509,031 tweets in total to train and predict political spectrums of politicians from 7 Northern European countries. We utilized NLP techniques such as vectorization, lemmatization, to transform the data set and machine learning models such as LSTM or CatBoost classifier to categorize the tweets. Our final model achieved a 0.71 score of accuracy.
